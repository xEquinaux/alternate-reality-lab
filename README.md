## Premise

Project: A game about a girl who was raised in a laboratory, alongside other people, being used for tests in a inhuman way. She escapes the laboratory and the city, then she discovers a post-apocaliptic world and tries to learn how to survive in this new ambient, where people try to kill and do other stuff to her. The vibes should be kinda like the last of us.

#### Extra

also, i forgot to mention that the city has a huge wall that separates the city from the devastated world, it shouldnt be a problem, since they let anyone leave through the door, and they wouldnt recognize that she is from the laboratory, as she will have changed appearances

1. There arent any zombies nor monsters, the  post apocaliptic thing is just the world being devastated

2. In the laboratory, the experiments, aka the girl and her colleagues were put through a bunch of bad things, almost psychological torture for the sake of science, its like 11 from stranger things, if you've watched it
